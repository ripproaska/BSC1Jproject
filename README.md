Computer Architecture 

The main theme of this project is to successfully run the operating system in the computer using another software known as virtual box. Virtual box is a cross-platform virtualization application it installs on your existing intel or AMD based computers, whether they are running windows, mac, Linux or Solaris operating systems at the same time. So the first system to install is Ubuntu. 
•	So to install the Ubuntu system in virtual box we need to start the new project naming the system Ubuntu. 
•	So after this we need to allocate the ram which can be default but as the Mcguin I put the same amount of ram for the box.
•	This is my first time using the virtual box so I create new hard disk and then next.
•	After the process it will ask us to choose a type of file for new virtual disk which I left in VDI (virtual disk image).
•	Choose the option Dynamically allocated which is getting an allocation from physical hard drive. The recommendation is to not choose the fixed size because we are not a daily user of virtual box. So fixed size takes longer than the usual time to create the virtual hard drive for the desired operating system. So that there could be also possibility that our disk might get crashed while generating virtually fixed size for an operating system. 
•	So after this the virtual disk will create a new which will create a new operating system.
•	So now the location and size of the virtual box can be changed or left default we can use some other drive to install the drive. 
•	The next thing to do to make the virtual hard drive useful is to add the downloaded Ubuntu disk image(.iso) boot on your virtual machine. Click on settings and storage. The under CD/DVD device next to empty, you’ll see a little folder icon.
•	After this select the Ubuntu .iso that we were supposed to download for the Moodle page. And after that select ok.  And the virtual machine will start up.
•	Just hit the continue to proceed. We are told to let the automatic download on but if we make it off this will save time during installation. With this option, installation time will extend to download the updates from the internet. My internet is not working properly at that time which took me hours to install the file, and also not need to install the third party software for graphic and flash etc. 
•	Installation type to choose the potion erase disk and install Ubuntu. It will erase the virtual hard disk which is allocated to install Ubuntu virtually. It will not erase the full drive of computer hard disk but only the allocated space, for the option to be worry only if you are installing on a different pc not virtually. Since the installation is running on virtual disk it is recommended to choose only “erase disk and install Ubuntu”. The encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security key for encryption purpose in next step. 
•	After the process we are asked to choose the language, location, and keyboard layout. 
•	So in a bit it will ask you to give a hostname, username and password we can encrypt the home directory if we want as well. 
•	And after some installation your server will be ready to use. 
•	So the first thing to do after the server boot up is to log in with the username and password.  And to make it visible to outside world we can change it to bridge adapter and restart it again
